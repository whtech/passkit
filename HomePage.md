# PassKit Documentation and Wiki #

This wiki covers the key concepts, tool and methods of PassK.it.  We want to provide everything you need to be able to quickly and easily get up and running; integrate PassKit into your processes and systems, and start issuing Passbook Passes to your customers.

We know that there may be situations (processes or systems) that we haven't accounted for, and while we have attempted to make this wiki exhaustive, please email us at anytime if you get stuck.

Equally, we are committed to excellence and will constantly update and refine our tools, methods and supporting processes. We always appreciate your input and collaboration to continually improve so everyone may benefit.  Thanks for your comments or additional useful content in this wiki.

We have tried to design the documentation so you can dive into the section that is most relevant for your needs.  However, if you are not familiar with Passbook or your first time we suggest making your way through the documentation in order.

And lastly, if you simply don't have the time to read the documentation, or have a 'written word' phobia just check out the [The lifecycle of a Pass diagram](PassLifecycle.md) and quickly watch the [Pass Designer intro video](PassDesignerVideo.md).
