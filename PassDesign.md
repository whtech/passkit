# Designing a Passbook Pass #

There are 5 easy keys steps to designing and creating a Passbook Pass.  With the [PassKit Pass Designer](https://create.passkit.com) this is all made very easy via a GUI:

  1. Decide the purpose of the Pass and select the Pass Type
  1. Use the Pass Designer to choose your colours, and upload any images
  1. Fill in the rest of the text information
  1. Include any text or images to support other languages (if appropriate)
  1. Choose whether the Pass should be public or private, unlimited or limited

Then save!

Onced saved in the Pass Designer you will be presented with a Pass link (and associated QR Code) that you you can easily distribute.

To see the Pass Designer in action check out [this video](PassDesignerVideo.md). It's less than 5 minutes but will give you a great feel for the simplistic process you can follow to quickly have great looking Passes.

Then [click here](PassType.md) for documentation to help you select which is the best Pass Type.
