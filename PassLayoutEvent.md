# Layout of the Event Ticket Pass #

Event Tickets Passes are for gaining entry to an event like a movie, a concert, the theatre or a sporting event. You could use a single Event Ticket Pass for several events, like a Season Ticket; although typically Event Ticket Passes are one-off Passes and correspond to a specific event.

## Supported Images ##

The Event Ticket Pass supports the following images:

  * Icon
  * Logo
  * Strip
  * Background
  * Thumbnail

If you choose to use a strip image you will not be able to have a background image or a thumbnail.  And if you choose a background image you will not be able to have a strip image.  i.e. a strip image cannot be placed over the top of a background image.

An Event Ticket Pass with a background image selected will automatically blur the image and this a design that is imposed by Apple.  You do not have to blur the image, you simply upload the background image that you want to use and the The Pass Designer will automatically simulate how this will look in Passbook.

## Field Constraints ##

You are not allowed Auxiliary Fields on an Event Ticket with a background image.
