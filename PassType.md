# Pass Type #

The first thing you need to do is choose what Pass Type you want to issue.

The Pass Type determines the visual appearance and the base template that is use for placement of information and images on the pass. This is predetermined by Apple and they have laid out the template in which each pass type would appear.  This can include the pass border design, location of images, text, and barcodes, as well as color schemes.

It's important to choose the right Pass Type as this will determine what you can put on the Pass and where it will appear in the Passbook app.  We strongly encourage you not to use a Membership Card for a Travel Ticket for example, as not only will it make the design process a little tricky for you it will also confuse your customer.

Fortunately the [Pass Designer](https://create.passkit.com) makes it very easy to change from one Pass Type to another, if you've got half way and you suddenly think it should be a different Pass Type.  Simply visit 'Pass Settings' Tab in the Pass Designer and change to

## [Event Ticket](PassLayoutEvent.md) ##

This Pass Type is appropriate for Passes used to gain entry to an event like a movie, a concert, the theatre or a sporting event. You could use a single Event Ticket Pass for several events, like a Season Ticket; although typically Event Ticket Passes are one-off Passes and correspond to a specific event.
