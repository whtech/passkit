# Distributing a Passbook Pass #

Distributing passes and getting them into Passbook is easy.  Once you have created and saved a Pass using the PassKit Pass Designer, you will be given a Pass URL.  You can now distribute this URL anyway that you normally share a URL.

| Distribution Channel | Examples |
|:---------------------|:---------|
| Via email            |  Copy the URL link into the email and then when the Pass recipient clicks on the link in the email they will be presented with the Pass and can then 'Add to Passbook'. |
| On the web           | If your customer is on mobile Safari in iOS 6 or OS X 10.8.2, users can tap on the URL to add them to Passbook. This can be a very convenient way to capture user information which then populate the Pass. |
| In an app            | Apps can easily link to the Pass URL, and then the user can 'Add to Passbook'.|
| Scanning             | You can also use the QR code generated on the Distribution View of the Pass Designer, or any other barcode format.  You could then put this on your web page, facebook page, app etc...or even on a paper flyer or a poster in your establishment.  The user can then scan the barcode and see the Pass on their iPhone and can 'Add to Passbook |

It's very important to note that the user does **not** need to have your app installed on a device in order to receive and add your pass to their Passbook. In fact, passes can exist and should be usable by users without a companion app altogether.

Even if you do not have an app you can still create and distribute passes to users who can add them via email or on the web and access them directly in Passbook.
